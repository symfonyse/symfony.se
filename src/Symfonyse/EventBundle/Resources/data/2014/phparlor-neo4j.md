Welcome to an other PHParlor. This time we will have two speaker who will present some of their work. We will be introduced
to Neo4j and listen to a interesting case study with Symfony2.

We will be serving beer and pizza. First talk starts at 6 PM.

## Speakers

Jacob Hansson from Neo Technologies will talk about graphs, graph databases and about the work he and others are doing
to allow PHP developers to use Neo4j to store their data. Assuming no prior knowledge about graphs, Jacob will explain
what a graph is, how your application data really is a graph, and what kinds of problems this allows you to solve.

Magnus Nordlander from Fervo will present a brand new case study, where they modernized an old PHP application using Symfony.
He will walk you through the technique they used to keep the legacy code running within Symfony and how the leveraged the different
components in the framework as well as Doctrine to bring order to the project.
